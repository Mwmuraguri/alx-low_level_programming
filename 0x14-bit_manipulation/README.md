0x14. C - Bit manipulation
C
Bitwise AND (&): This operator takes two numbers and performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is a number where each bit is set to 1 if and only if both corresponding bits in the operands are 1.

Bitwise OR (|): This operator takes two numbers and performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is a number where each bit is set to 1 if either corresponding bit in the operands is 1.

Bitwise XOR (^): This operator takes two numbers and performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result is a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits in the operands are different.

Bitwise NOT (~): This operator takes a single number and performs a bitwise NOT operation on each bit, which results in a number where each bit is the opposite of the corresponding bit in the operand.

Left shift (<<): This operator takes a number and shifts all its bits to the left by a specified number of positions. The result is a number that is equivalent to the original number multiplied by 2 to the power of the shift amount.

Right shift (>>): This operator takes a number and shifts all its bits to the right by a specified number of positions. The result is a number that is equivalent to the original number divided by 2 to the power of the shift amount.
